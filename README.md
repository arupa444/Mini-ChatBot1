# Mini-ChatBot1

Hey, We made a mini chatbot in which we used some machine learning libraries to complete this but we weren't able to embed this into the website<br>
Step 1: The data was extracted from sQuAd dataset using Json<br>
Step 2: Data was cleansed by removing the unnecessary columns<br>
Step 3: After cleansing we did some preprocessing like lemmatizing,stemmming,removing punctuations etc. <br>
Step 4: Then tokenization was done which converting sentences into words etc.<br>
Step 5: After this we splitted the data for training using train_test_split<br>
Step 6: After training we used pipeline for vectorization and training purpose<br>
Step 7: For training Multiomial Naive Bayes theorem was used<br><br>

The accuracy is not good but this is our first time making so we will update the improvements and please raise if there is anything you can help us .
